I try to write something in pure english,just because I dont install a pinyin input method on my linux mint.

I read the book REWORK many times,so it's a good chance to practice my poor english.

First rule ,avoid to query word by google when I am writing.

Second rule,use simple words and avoid complex gramar.

Last rule,leran words from REWORK.

Ok,restart the writing road.

The content will mostly about small business.Under the sky ,no hard business,just soft person.I wanna start my business and have trid several times ,but just have failures.

I have learned many skills about internet ,about programming.I trid to build adsense website early in  2007,also made some mobile app to earning money.Finally do more,learn more,but earn less.

After say good bye to university,I have worked four years ,another peroid of university. I wanna make a dent, but the old-sky-dad ignored me. A huge Long in my deep where of heart,drived me to try again.

In the past four years, mobie devices stronger and stronger,people also more and more. Obvisouly, product can meet more and more consumers.Find the need,make product,sell it,repeat sell ,it's simple and clearly.

Above all,a lot of big words ,I boring those.Talk some jobs.

I worte a app,flower bridge text,named FBText.Some ideas from vim ,some ideas  from sublime.My idea is simple ,make a editor which can be used in terminal,also in web browser,and in desktop,and in modible phone.Now its a half-product,more functions wait me, but I dont konw to wait what.Ok ,take easy, next step, i will make some  magic command to make it alive.

I worte a mobile app, which is a app launcher based on web tech.You can modify the html/js/css code to diy UI.I'm not a good designer,but I have used this simple launcher several months. 

What make me a dent,it's simple html/javasript/css code.Everyone can use it esaily.

Commit here.
